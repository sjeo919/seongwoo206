		DOWNLOAD
_____________________________________________________________________


The download frame can be opened from the main Vamix Window by
clicking on the "Download" button. The Download frame requires a
 URL input of the media file you want to download. The download
 process will not commence if the URL is not open source. Once the
 Download button is pressed, and the "yes" option for checking
 whether the URL is open source is selected, the download process
 will begin. On completion of download, the file will be saved into
 the current directory.

To play a media file from the media player, the "Play" button must
 be pressed which opens up a file chooser window. Navigate to the
 directory of the file and press "Open". If the file is not a valid
 media type, an error message will be shown. This media player
 supports ".mp4", ".mp3", ".aac", ".mov", ".avi" files.

		Playback Control
_____________________________________________________________________

The media player window contains a menu bar, buttons, a seek bar
 and a volume control bar which all have functionalities that
 provide ease of use to the user. 
	
The skip, play, rewind and fast forward buttons allow you to
navigate through the video easily.
The Skip buttons skip forward or backwards by 4 seconds
The rewind buttons continuously skip forwards or backwards through
the video until the play button is resumed.
The play button toggles between play and pause depending on the
state of the media; whether it is paused or playing. 
There is also a mute button and a volume control bar which allows 
the user to change the playback volume. The volume will be set to 
zero when the mute button is pressed and when it is pressed again, 
the volume will be set to the previous volume before mute was 
pressed.

		Extract
_____________________________________________________________________

There are two ways to perform extraction of audio:
 
The audio from the media currently playing can be stripped off and 
saved as a new audio file. To do this, press the "Extract Audio" 
button located on the bottom right of the media player window. When
 pressed, a pop up window asks for a new name to save the audio file
 as. The newName should be entered without any extensions. If an 
extension is entered an error message will be shown. If a file with 
the same name already exists in the directory, the user will have to
 decide whether to override the file or cancel extraction and save the
 file with a unique name. Once a valid name for the file is entered,
 extraction of the audio will commence and the file will be saved 
into the directory.

There is an "Extract" button on the main vamix window which allows a 
different type of extraction. This extraction allows you to extract 
audio from an audio file AND a video file with a specified time. 
Extraction of audio will 'cut' the length of the audio file and 
extraction of video files will extract audio from video AND 'cut' 
audio length to user specified time. The extraction time may not 
exceed the total length of the file. An error message will be shown 
if the time exceeds the length. All fields must be entered and should 
be of valid format. Once this is true extraction will commence, 
otherwise an error message will be shown.

		Add Text
_____________________________________________________________________

Text can be added to the opening and closing scenes of the video by 
a specified time. To do so, the "Add Text" button located at the botton 
right of the media player window should be clicked. Once clicked, a 
new pop up frame will request the user for the desired text and time 
(in seconds) for both the opening and closing scenes. It also requires 
a new name for the text contained video to be saved as. There are 
various font, font size and font color types and one of these for each 
must be selected.

		Edit Video
_____________________________________________________________________

_____________________________OVERLAY_________________________________

There is a menu bar at the top left conrner of the media player window. 
The first option is overlaying audio on video. This takes the current 
video and an input audio file from the user and merges the two together 
to produce an output video with both the original and the new audio 
file as its audio component. When "Overlay Audio on Video" is selected, 
an input audio and a new name for the new video to be saved will be 
required. Once all correct inputs are given, overlay process will 
commence and the completed video file will be saved into the current 
directory

_____________________________REPLACE_________________________________

The second option from the drop down menu is "Replace Audio on Video". 
This will remove the audio component from the current video and add 
in a new audio component from an audio file specified by the user. 
The same input is required for "Replace" as "Overlay". Once all 
correct inputs are given, the audio replacing process will begin and 
the completed video file will be saved into the currene directory.
